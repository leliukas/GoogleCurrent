# The Clone of Current Google

I have created this webpage due to a task given at [patika.dev](patika.dev), a website helps Turkish newbies to start their developer careers, for free.

This project made me spend around 7 hours, which is a lot considering I created [1998 Google Page](https://leliukas.github.io/Google-Clone/) yesterday in 80 minutes.

I liked it.
